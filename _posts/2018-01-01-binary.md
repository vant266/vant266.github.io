The language of a machine is built from the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, and the dictionary derived from all finite concatenation of arbitrary numbers of elements, or bits, from this alphabet. For example, $0001101010111$, or $01010101$, or just $000$ are strings within the language. 

In an _abstract computing machine_, binary numbers must map all operations and concepts. For the purposes of arithmetic, some useful facts about binary representation are outlined.  

> Every positive integer has a unique binary representation--that is, every integer can be expressed as a unique sum of distinct powers of two, with coefficents 0 or 1 .


The proof is ...
